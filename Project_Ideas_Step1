Capstone: 
1. Unknown Pleasures: A landing page with a Mad Lib-esque One-liner. Once you land on the page, it will show you a sentence and you fill in a few blanks, and then get a bespoke playlist.
2. Movie tracker: An app that tracks movies you would like to see/and have completed watching. 
3. A music stumble upon discovery app

● Write a short blurb explaining each of your ideas.
Concept: On load, users see a single sentence with blanks (dropdowns). As they choose words, the app translates those choices into a music query and instantly returns a curated “playlist” of tracks with 30-sec previews.
Example prompt:
“I’m feeling [mood] while [activity]—give me [intensity] [genre].”

Inputs (small, opinionated set):
mood: happy / dark / calm / moody

activity: studying / driving / gym / party

intensity: chill / medium / banger

genre: electronic / indie / pop / hip-hop / rock

Output: A grid of tracks (artwork, title, artist) with audio previews and a “regenerate” button.

MVP tech: Vite + React. Fetch songs via the iTunes Search API (no auth) and assemble a “playlist” client-side.
Stretch goals: Spotify Recommendations (with tiny backend), shareable URLs, “Save preset,” subtle animations, toggle between sources.
Vibe: Minimal, dark theme (nod to Joy Division), focus on the sentence as the central interaction.



Describe the problem and the data you'll be using to solve it. 
This will be more of a curated playlist
